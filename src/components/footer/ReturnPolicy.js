            At Keshri Store, your health and safety are our highest priority. Due to the nature of our tobacco products, we maintain a strict no return, no refund, and no exchange policy.
          </p>

          <div className="return-notice">
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</strong> Once purchased, our products cannot be returned under any circumstances. This is to ensure the integrity, hygiene, and safety of our offerings.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>1. Why No Returns?</h2>
          <p>
            Tobacco products are consumable and sensitive in nature. Once they leave our facility, we cannot guarantee that they havenâ€™t been tampered with or altered. There have been cases where the contents of a product were changed and returned, which poses serious risks to customer safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to this, and in compliance with health regulations, we do not accept returns even if a product remains sealed. This helps us maintain high safety standards and protect all our customers.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Order Accuracy and Inspection</h2>
          <p>
            We strongly encourage customers to double-check their order before completing the purchase. All orders are thoroughly inspected and securely packaged before shipping to ensure product quality and accuracy.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Damaged or Incorrect Items</h2>
          <p>
            In the rare event that you receive a severely damaged or incorrect item, please contact us at <strong>keshritobacco.store@gmail.com</strong> or call us at <strong>(+91) 9955059485</strong> within 48 hours of delivery. While we cannot accept returns, we will evaluate each case to determine if corrective action is needed.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Cancellations</h2>
          <p>
            Orders can only be canceled if they have not yet been processed or shipped. Once an order is processed, it cannot be canceled or modified due to the no return policy.
          </p>
